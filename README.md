# WebFeatureAddReact

This project contains a React application which makes an HTTP request for an array of countries, and displays some of the data in a table. The goal of this exercise is to enhance that table with some features.
* Filtering - allows user to filter by a column or columns
* Sorting - allows user to sort by one or more columns
* Pagination - allows code to be modified to only show a certain number of records at a time
* Combine some of the above features

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
